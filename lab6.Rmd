## Introduction

On May 20, 2013 an extremely powerful and devastating tornado struck
Moore, Oklahoma, a city just south of Oklahoma City. The tornado was over one
mile wide and had a maximum wind speed of 210 mph. This area is a known hotbed 
for tornadic activity. In fact, the 2013 Moore tornado followed a very similar 
path as two other large tornadoes that hit the area in 1999 and 2003, 
respectively.

How would you quantify the risk of living in certain areas of the Oklahoma
City metro? This lab will get you started in answering that question with a
focus on obtaining some of the necessary data using web scraping techniques
and APIs.

<br/>

## Data

### OK tornadoes

<div class="bkgemph">
Scrape data from http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com to get all
tornadoes recorded in Oklahoma from 1998 - 2017. Do this in 
`R/get_tornadoes.R`. Save your final data object with `saveRDS()` 
in folder `data`. Below, load your data with `readRDS()`
</div>

```{r load_tornadoes}

```

<br/>

### OKC school district boundaries

<div class="bkgemph">
Navigate to https://data.okc.gov/portal/page/api. The city of Oklahoma City 
Open Data Portal has an API available that gives access to service, zoning,
public safety, and school data. Use the API to obtain the school district
boundaries.

Similar to the last section, do this in `R/get_school_districts.R`.
Save your object with `saveRDS()` in folder `data`. Below, load your 
data with `readRDS()`.
</div>

```{r load_school_districts}

```

<br/>

### OKC fire stations

<div class="bkgemph">
Navigate to https://data.okc.gov/portal/page/api. The city of Oklahoma City 
Open Data Portal has an API available that gives access to service, zoning,
public safety, and school data. Use the API to obtain the fire stations.

Similar to the last section, do this in `R/get_fire_stations.R`.
Save your object with `saveRDS()` in folder `data`. Below, load your 
data with `readRDS()`.
</div>

```{r load_fire_stations}

```

<br/>

## Analysis

*Not required, but something to think about if you were to proceed further.*

<div class="bkgemph">
How would you develop a risk metric for each school district given the 
historical tornado data and fire station data? What other data may be valuable
to you for your analysis?
